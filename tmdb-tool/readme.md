# TMDB CLI TOOL - THE MOVIE DATABASE

## Requirement

The application should run from the command line, and be able to pull and show the popular, top-rated, upcoming and now playing movies from the TMDB API. The user should be able to specify the type of movies they want to see by passing a command line argument to the CLI tool.

## Implementation

- Handle errors gracefully, such as API failures or network issues.
- Use a programming language of your choice to build this project.
- Make sure to include a README file with instructions on how to run the application and any other relevant information.
